# Hactoberfest-2023

🌱 Exciting News! 🌱

I am thrilled to share that I contributed to Hacktoberfest and received a special gift for my pull request! 🎉

🌳 As part of this event, I had the opportunity to plant a tree through my pull request on GitHub, and it feels amazing to contribute to a greener planet. 🌍

If you're not familiar with Hacktoberfest, it's an annual event where developers from around the world come together to contribute to open-source projects. It's a fantastic way to give back to the community and learn from others.

I encourage you all to join in and make a difference too! Let's create a positive impact through open-source collaboration. 🤝
